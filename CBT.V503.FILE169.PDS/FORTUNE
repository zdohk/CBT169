needs to open 20 doors and has twenty keys (S = 1), a secretary has to open two
doors with one key (S = 2), but the president never has to carry around any
keys since there is always someone around to open doors for him (with K = 0 and

Whereas in many branches of economic activity employment depends on the number

While bryographic plants are typically encountered in substrata of earthly or
mineral matter in concreted state, discrete substrata elements occasionally
display a roughly spherical configuration which, in presence of suitable
gravitational and other effects, lends itself to combined translatory and
rotational motion.  One notices in such cases an absence of the otherwise
typical accretion of bryophyta.  We therefore conclude that a rolling stone
gathers no moss.
